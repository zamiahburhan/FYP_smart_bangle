FYP_smart_bangle
This repository contains the Arduino-based prototype of a Smart Bangle, developed as part of a Final Year Project (FYP). The bangle is designed to assist in safety and health monitoring by integrating heart rate sensing and hazard detection. The Project motivation is to make the dementia, autism people have better access for  their health progress.

📌 Features
1. Abnormal Heart Rate Detection – using pulse sensor (potentiometer used for simulation).
2. Hazard Detection – using ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04).
3. Alert System – buzzer and LED indicators.
4. ON/OFF Control – via push button.
5. (Future scope) GSM/GPS integration for live alerts and tracking.
